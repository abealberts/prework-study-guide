# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a quick reference guide made for the purpose of taking notes for the University of Wisconsin Extended Campus Development Boot Camp. The contents of the webpage includes general notes taken throughout pre-course materials on the subject of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I plan to reorganize and add content to this webpage throughout the Development Boot Camp.

- This was a pre-course excercise designed to familiarise ourselves with basic development concepts.
- This webpage enables myself, as well as fellow/future students, to quickly review prework concepts all on one page.
- Through building this webpage, I was able to learn and understand many fundamental building blocks of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Enough, at least, to build a webpage from scratch using basic techniques.

Each section on the Prework Study Guide Webpage contains my personal notes on the listed subject matter (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript).

Opening the web console will show the JavaScript at work. The script is designed to print the 4 topics listed on the webpage, and then randomly select a subject to study. Open up the console to see which topic you should spend some time on!

        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. This includes things like the language, website title, character set, and more.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. This includes text, images, graphic elements, etc.</li>
            <li>Sections of content within the HTML body can be identified by CSS, JavaScript, etc., by assigning "classes" (class=) and "IDs" (id=)</li>
            <li>HTML essentially acts as the building blocks or skeleton of a website. CSS assigns styles to HTML content, and JavaScript gives it function.</li>
            <li>...</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) effectively assigns styles to content you've coded in HTML.</li>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS can be written directly inline in your HTML for permanent changes made to specific sections/parts of HTML.</li>
          <li>CSS can be written as an internal stylesheet, making style changes only to HTML on the current page/HTML file.</li>
          <li>For most applications, CSS can be written in an external style sheet and linked into the head of your HTML, making changes to anything within the HTML and written in a separate .css file.</li>
          <li>When writing CSS, you can add properties to HTML items directly by name (header, footer, h1, ul, p, etc.) or by calling a class (i.e: .card{})</li>
          <li>Various modifiers can be applied to your HTML code, including height/width, margins, padding, border, shadow, color, justification, and much more.</li>
          <li>...</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
